I added a lot of new features since the last release.

## Test environments
* local Windows 7 install, R 3.4.0
* Linux on a Unix cluster, R 3.3.2
* Ubuntu 12.04.5 (on travis-ci), R 3.3.3
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

win-builder suggests that "metamodeling" is a misspelled word
in the DESCRIPTION, but it is correct.

## Downstream dependencies

None, this is a new release.
